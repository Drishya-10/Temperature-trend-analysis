The project contains two parts which is basically training and the final project. 
The training part contains a satellite image from NASA. CV2 is used for image processing, the colour saturations are converted into BGR scheme. The K-means clustering have been applied inorder to cluster the similar colour schemes together so that the temperature's dominant color regions can be found out. This can help in coverting complex image to meaningful temp classes.
The final project have an interface made with the help of Gradio.
